# Spreedy
This is an app I created a while back when learning the basics of web development using react.js. 

This app is intended for helping those with learning difficulties, those who read slow, or anyone who just wants to read in a faster manner.

I built this app in mind for my dyslexic friend who told me that he struggles to read due to the large volume of words on the screen/page at a time.

Spreedy helps you ignore distractions focussing on one word at a time, in order to help you read faster.

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
